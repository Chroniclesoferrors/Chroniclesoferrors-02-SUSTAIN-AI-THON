## INTRODUCTION
Our Digital Mental Wellness Platform is an innovative solution designed to foster mental health awareness and reduce stigma among students. Featuring gamified missions, peer support networks, and anonymous counseling powered by a Gen AI chatbot, it keeps users engaged while promoting help-seeking behavior. The platform’s highlight is a weekly progress tracker that analyzes daily journal entries using the machine learning model (BERT-fine tuned with a large dataset) to identify cognitive distortions and emotions from the journal given by the user by providing personalized mental health insights based on the variation of the distortion in the sentences. Users can share experiences, exchange tips, and access curated mental health resources in peer social networks to build a supportive community. Together, we empower students to prioritize their mental well-being in an engaging, stigma-free environment with educative articles in the blog for both students and parents.\

# NOVELTY
<mark>WEEKLY PROGRESS:</mark>\
We’ve trained an ML model that identifies the cognitive distortion in the sentence that is given by the user in the daily journal. Then we collect the sentences all over the week to generate a report on the variation of the distorted part and the emotion in the sentences over the week. (helps students understand their thinking patterns and promotes positive thinking).\
<mark>DAILY MISSIONS:</mark>\
To increase the students' engagement, we give points upon completing the missions (eg, points for daily login, etc) and we’ll have a dedicated leaderboard that features all the user's points.\
<mark>ANONYMOUS COUNSELLING:</mark>\
To encourage people to open up about their problems, we’ve used Llama 2-7-b (GEN AI), which can guide users based on their problems and this eliminates the fear of being judged, hence improving help-seeking behavior

# Proposed solution
The proposed solution is a digital mental wellness platform to engage students and promote better mental health. Key features include gamified missions that reward users with points for active participation, encouraging long-term usage. A peer support network allows users to share their thoughts, tips, and overcoming stories, fostering a supportive community. An AI-powered chatbot offers anonymous counseling, ensuring privacy and accessibility.

The platform collects daily journal entries as part of the missions, which are analyzed by a machine learning model to identify cognitive distortions and associated emotions. This data generates personalized weekly progress reports, acting as a mental health tracker. Additionally, the platform provides curated mental health articles to raise awareness and reduce stigma. Parent and teacher dashboards enable collaboration while maintaining privacy. By combining engagement, education, and progress tracking, the platform effectively encourages help-seeking behavior and supports students' mental well-being.
