<mark>INTRODUCTION</mark>\
Our Digital Mental Wellness Platform is an innovative solution designed to foster mental health awareness and reduce stigma among students. Featuring gamified missions, peer support networks, and anonymous counseling powered by a Gen AI chatbot, it keeps users engaged while promoting help-seeking behavior. The platform’s highlight is a weekly progress tracker that analyzes daily journal entries using the machine learning model (BERT-fine tuned with a large dataset) to identify cognitive distortions and emotions from the journal given by the user by providing personalized mental health insights based on the variation of the distortion in the sentences. Users can share experiences, exchange tips, and access curated mental health resources in peer social networks to build a supportive community. Together, we empower students to prioritize their mental well-being in an engaging, stigma-free environment with educative articles in the blog for both students and parents.\

<mark>NOVELTY</mark>\
<mark>WEEKLY PROGRESS:</mark>\
We’ve trained a ML model which identifies the cognitive distortion in the sentence which is given by the user in the daily journal and then we collect the sentences all over the week to generate a report on the variation of the distorted part and the emotion in the sentences over the week.(helps students to understand their pattern of thinking and promotes positive thinking).\
<mark>DAILY MISSIONS:</mark>\
To increase the engagement of the students, we give points upon completing the missions (eg: points for daily login, etc) and we’ll be having a dedicated leaderboard which features all the users points.\
<mark>ANONYMOUS COUNSELLING:</mark>\
To encourage people to open up about their problems, we’ve used Llama 2-7-b (GEN AI), which has the ability to guide users based on their problems and this eliminates the fear of being judged, hence improving help-seeking behaviour
