introduction
Our Digital Mental Wellness Platform is an innovative solution designed to foster mental health awareness and reduce stigma among students. Featuring gamified missions, peer support networks, and anonymous counselling powered by a Gen AI chatbot, it keeps users engaged while promoting help-seeking behaviour. The platform’s highlight is a weekly progress tracker that analyzes daily journal entries using the machine learning model (BERT-fine tuned with large dataset) to identify cognitive distortions and emotions from the journal given by the user by providing personalized mental health insights based on the variation of the distortion in the sentences . Users can share experiences, exchange tips, and access curated mental health resources in the peer social networks to build a supportive community. Together, we empower students to prioritize their mental well-being in an engaging, stigma-free environment with educative articles in the blog for both students and parents.
